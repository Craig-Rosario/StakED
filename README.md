# StakED - The On-Chain Confidence Market üèÜ

### A Web3 Platform for Academic Performance Staking

**StakED** is a decentralized application (dApp) built to **gamify academic motivation** and ensure integrity in grading. Students stake tokens on their predicted academic performance, while verifiers (teachers/examiners) commit and reveal grades on-chain using a verifiable process. Winners earn a proportional share of the forfeited stakes from those who failed to meet their goals.

## üöÄ Key Features

| Feature | Description | On-Chain/Off-Chain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Staking** | Students lock tokens to bet on their own success (e.g., scoring $\ge 75\%$ on an exam). | Hybrid (Token Transfer $\rightarrow$ On-Chain Stake) |
| **Peer Staking** | Students can stake on the expected performance of their classmates, creating a dynamic, peer-driven confidence market. | Hybrid (Token Transfer $\rightarrow$ On-Chain Stake) |
| **Verifier Integrity** | Verifiers can create exams, set deadlines, and manage classes. The platform uses a **commit-reveal** process for grading to prevent results tampering. | On-Chain (Verifier Registry, Exam Management) |
| **Prediction-Based Payout** | Winners are determined by accuracy: **actual score $\ge$ predicted score**. Forfeited stakes from losers are distributed among winning stakers. | On-Chain (Calculated in `ExamStaking.claim()`) |
| **PYUSD as Staking Token** | **PayPal USD (PYUSD)** is used as the base staking and reward token, providing a stable, regulated asset for financial incentives. | On-Chain (via `IERC20` interface) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, ShadCN UI | Student and Verifier Dashboards. |
| **Backend (API)** | **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB** | Off-chain data (user profiles, class/exam metadata), and API for the frontend. |
| **Smart Contracts** | **Solidity** (`0.8.17+`), **Hardhat v3** | Core logic for staking, prediction-based winner determination, and payout distribution. |
| **Web3 Integration** | **Ethers.js** | Handles wallet connections, transaction signing, and contract calls. |

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

The core functionality is managed by modular Solidity contracts, emphasizing separation of concerns for clarity and security.

| Contract | Purpose | Key Roles |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ExamStaking.sol` | Main interaction point for staking, grading, and reward payout. | `Owner`, `Verifier`, `Student` |
| `VerifierRegistry.sol` | Manages the list of authorized teacher/examiner wallet addresses. | `onlyAdmin`, `isVerifier` |
| `StudentRegistry.sol` | Manages registration of student wallet addresses. | `onlyAdmin`, `isRegistered` |

### Key Functions (in `ExamStaking.sol`)

| Function | Purpose | On-Chain Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `stake(..., uint256 predictedScore)` | Transfers PYUSD and records the stake on-chain along with the expected score. | `pyusd.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount)` |
| `setStudentScores(..., uint256[] scores)` | **Verifier** submits final scores. The contract determines winners based on `actual_score >= predicted_score`. | Sets `e.actualScores` and `e.isWinner` |
| `distributeRewards(bytes32 examId)` | Finalizes the exam and initiates the reward pool distribution logic. | Sets `e.finalized = true` |
| `claim(bytes32 examId)` | Calculates and sends the appropriate reward (original stake + proportional share of loser pool) to the staker. | `pyusd.safeTransfer(msg.sender, finalAmount)` |

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started (Development)

The project is structured into three main directories: `contracts`, `backend`, and `frontend`.

### 1. Smart Contracts Setup (`contracts/`)

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd contracts
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Set up your `.env` file with your **Sepolia RPC URL** and private key for deployment.
3.  **Deployment**: Deploy the core contracts, including `VerifierRegistry`, `StudentRegistry`, and `ExamStaking`, to the Sepolia testnet.
    ```bash
    npm run deploy:sepolia 
    # Recommended: npm run deploy:final to use the final prediction-based contract
    ```

### 2. Backend Setup (`backend/`)

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Create a `.env` file for **`MONGO_URI`**, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, and your Sepolia RPC/Private Key.
3.  **Run**: Start the API server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### 3. Frontend Setup (`frontend/`)

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure**: Update environment variables (`.env` file) with deployed contract addresses and the backend API URL.
3.  **Run**: Start the React application.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
